          Hi, my name is Xin Rui Li. I live in Montreal, Canada. 
          <br/>
          You can reach out to me at <code>li.xinrui3 at gmail dot com</code>
        </p>

        <p>This site is meant to be a brief introduction of myself. 
          A brief rundown on past experiences, things I&apos;ve built, and stuff that I find interesting.
        </p>

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I am currently obtaining a B.Sc. in Computer Science from McGill University,
            with a focus on Data Science and Machine Learning. â€”
            I am a tutor at the <a href="https://mcgill-csus.ca">Computer Science Undergraduate Society</a>,
            and I was a VP at the <a href="https://mcgillai.com">McGill Artificial Intelligence Society</a> (now Senior Advisor).
          </li>
          <li>
            I&apos;m a full-stack software engineer by trade, 
            with professional experience mostly in web and mobile development. 
          </li>
          <li>
            In my free time, I like to work on game development, embedded systems, financial tools, and other random stuff.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Technical stuff</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
          I really love AI&ML, and I&apos;ve been hanging out with the folks at McGill Artificial Intelligence society to feed my interest. 
          It&apos;s been awesome because I&apos;ve both learned a ton about AI&ML and got to help others out. 
          Plus, I&apos;ve become pretty good at using Python and exploring all its ecosystem.
          </li>
          <li>
            For front-end web technologies, I have experience with both React and Angular, 
            as well as the meta-frameworks built around them. 
            Although I prefer to stick with React and TypeScript.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the back-end, I built most of my things using Node.js, Express.js and Flask.
            However, I&apos;m also experimenting with Go, 
            as well as Rust + axum for <i><b> blazingly fast </b></i> results! ðŸ¦€
          </li>
        </ul>
